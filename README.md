**Background:** <br>
Since the mid-80's, microchip implants have been used in pets and livestocks to identify them. These implements are a little larger than a rice grain. They are passive RFID chips that must be remotely powered to receive the identification information. They are progressively been required by law. <br>

Beside legal identification, these microchips can be used to identify a pet when they want to be fed (i.e., not allow an obese pet to over eat) or to let them enter or exit their home. The latter prevents "foreign" cats to enter homes where they have no business to be in. <br>

There is a problem when the orientation of the scanner's antenna and the microchips are not aligned. The pet doors and feeders are battery powered and fixed. The former results in not enough power to retrieve the information, while the latter could have been a solution by rotating the antenna (or chip inside the pet). <br>

**Objective:** <br>
The project is simply to design a low power antenna that allows the microchip to be read whatever is its relative orientation. <br>

**Key features:** <br>
* **Compatibility:** The solution must be ISO 11784 and ISO 11785 compliant. That is, it must be able to be optimized for 134.2 kHz, but should also be able to read at 125 kHz for US microchips.
* **Low power:** The cat door should work 6 months on four AA batteries.
* **Size:** It should fit in a pet door.
* **Temperature:** It should function in temperatures from -20°C to 60°C.
* **Internet ready:** The solution should be able to integrate a secured solution that connects to the Internet. This could include near field communication (NFC), bluetooth, and WiFi solutions.
