IR sensors
pulseTime: int
sensor1Active: bool (or int??)
sensor2Active: bool

standby() //aka pulse
foundObject() //send signal to motor to both open and close 
turnOff() //Use only in foundObject, to kill power to the other sensor 
turnOn() //Get signal from antenna to turn back on 


Motor
motorDirection: int //0 for left, 1 for right, for example
motorControl: int //0 for off, 1 for on
threshold: int //set reasonable value for the cat to change its mind

turnOn() //turn on motor, set direction, after taking variable from IR
turnOff() //turn off the motor, set direction, after getting signal from IR, or threshold. 


Button
holdTime: int //user input, how long is the button pressed for?
threshold: int //threshold for how long the button has to be pressed to turn on/off

buttonPressed()
programCat()


Antenna
catInfo: string
