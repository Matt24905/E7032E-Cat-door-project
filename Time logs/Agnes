[Forgot to log more]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                WEEK 43
- Get gains and values to work with attiny85 from separate power supply.
- Make a 150 ms loop and tests on oscilloscope.
- Extend circuit and code to include another IR sensor pair and commute accordingly to RaspberryPI (cat inside/outside).


Monday
- No meeting.


Tuesday
- Laptop crashed..
- Got trouble with circuit.
- Computer didn't detect attiny85.
- DC source might have too high current.
- Struggles.


Wednesday
- Made IDE Thonny work again.
- Re-wrote script and tested response with LEDs.


Thursday
- Reinstalled drivers for attiny with Arduino. Worked the third time to detect it and upload scripts again. Happy because thought I might have destroyed it with too high current from DC source..
- Tried useing pinout to power the diodes and op amp but did not work. I guess too low current?
- Will try with a switch or relay to periodically power them instead.
- Had a relay from a electronic kit so read a bit about that component or if other option (switch) is better. Relay seems good.



Friday
- Worked on correct limits when attiny was powered from separate source (not USB) 5V which changes the range for the analog input in bits.
- Tried change in voltage script instead of limits but did not work so well. Setting limits around bias seems more stable.
- IR diode seemed to be running hot so changed to 3.3 voltage and higer resistor with higher gain on amp.
- Still difficult to find limits and bias seems to change everytime I start circuit for some reason...
- Also laptop stopped detecting attiny again >___< Installed everything on stationary computer. Worked. Reinstalled Arduino IDE and all the drivers several times on laptop (different options for Digispark). Suddenly worked.


Saturday
- Invesigated why bias changes everytime I startup circuit...!
- Tried adding cpacitors didn't help much.
- attiny has been acting so weird and drivers stops working. Tomorrow I will just move the system to Raspberry Pi for now and see what to do... Maybe try/order another low power microcontroller?
- Order other op amp or one that fits into breadboard.
- Order other low power microcontroller?


Sunday
- Finally figured out why laptop couldn't recognize attiny85.... had no voltage on but had a ground cable in +_+ 
- Tried an relay or for powering diodes and amp circuit but just quick guide and think I did it wrong. Seems to be for higher voltages. Switch probably better.
- Still hard to find exact limits for voltages to bits. Especially for grey objects wich gives a smaller response! 
- Tried 'react on change' script but couldn't get it to work.
- The response seems pretty slow when checked in Raspberry Pi.
- Built a double ir-sensor circuit wich reacts on two photodiodes. Had to test a bit to find which AC input worked on attiny85."P2 = A1; P4 = A2;" only way to make them actually work. (Pin 2 and 4).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                WEEK 42
THIS WEEK:

✔ Got the OP amp -> Build circuit!
- Remember to add input signal to Rasp Pi from wich side cat comes (high/low)
- Remember to send the Matlab script to group for making consistent graphs in the report.
- Write report!


Tips från Johan:   MCP6L01


Monday
- Grand Meeting / Presentation
- Project Room discussions regarding components and check out the delivery :)


Tuesday
- Soldered (pcb) op amp LM358 for testing gain.
- Built circuit. Tested. Working. 
- Soldering broke. Soldered again.
- Researched RTTINY85: the ADC has 10 bits! Should be enough.
- Raspberry Pi script suddenly don't work. Need to fix.


Wednesday
- Group meeting 10:15
- Probably fix problems with circuit and amplifier. Can we get higher photodiode current? Mutistage amplifier?
- Check/adjust frequency of sensor
- Check resolution of ATTINY85 with oscilloscope
- Make switch if Raspberry PI Pico has no "turn on" pin.
- Test PCB circuit (can 100k be enough? Calculations in nano-range current needs mega ohm:s feedback resistor.


Thursday
- The op amps ordered were for pcb so soldered legs on it to fit breadboard +_+ Took a while. But we had music.
- Soldered pcb broke
- Got help to re-solder it. Not 100% sure if it works.
- Read datasheet to figure out characteristics and pin out. 


Friday
- Went to lab to do tests on original catflap.
- Looking to pickup other (breadboard) op amp. Not there.


Saturday
- Tested circuits again (!)
- Can't make the transimpedance one to work.
- Discovered that only the right part of (dual op amp) works the hard way. xP
- BUT thought that the voltage change we managed to get with adjusting resistors might be enough for a non inverting amp.
- WORKED. 
- Calculated and simulated in PSpice to get a suitable gain with limits within 0-3.3 V.

Sunday
- Adjusted circuit and feedback resistors and got a good working circuit.gh  
- Programmed limits in attiny85 so a lamp blinks for both a spike and a dip in voltage (white and black cat).
- Still need to adjust limits for when current source is not through micro USB...!
- Some crash issues that made me have to re-set up arduino and re write the code...

    - Went well! Programmed RTTINY85 through Arduino IDE
    - Tested script with separate voltage source
    - Need to borrow another micro USB ._. But. Can do without.

Thursday
    - Built circuit where RTTINY85 reads analog input and if voltage over certain bits -> Blue LED on
    - Got everything to work with only Raspberry Pi plugged in but could be unplugged and use RTTINY85 as power source.
    - Struggled a bit with finding the correct levels (voltage to bits). Apparently RTTINY85 adapts to it's input voltage to it's 8bits?
    - Will have to adapt range from the amplifier perfectly since it has so small resolution. Or pick a better (higher res) low power microcontroller!

Friday
    - Make RTTINY85 start Raspberry PI when "cat" detected (instead of the blue LED). 
          💭 Do we need a separate voltage source to start RPI instead?
    - Write script to detect absolute DIFFERENCE in voltage (instead of over certain level). 
          💭 Over how long time?
    - Implement PWM signal that turns on IR diode + Photodiode in 150ms intervalls for about 1ms tops.
    (- Test on oscilloscope, check that it is properly 150ms/1ms)
    (- Correctly map voltage to bits on RTTINY85 with DC source) 
          💭 Is it possible to "print" values from low power microcontroller..?
    - Simulate and design amplifier circuit in PSpice.

Sunday
    - Bought another micro USB to be able to program/read values from attiny and Raspberry Pi at the same time.

                                WEEK 40

    TODO: 
    - Test both actual current response and input via Raspberry Pi
    - Learn Raspberry PI and Python coding
    - Actually WRITE REPORT and TIME LOG
    - Start with a simple circuit -> Build amplifier if needed.

Monday
    Grand Meeting / Presentation.

Tuesday
    Group meeting 10:15
    Got to take over task to build IR circuit.
    Calculated some forward currents etc for circuit.
    Completed a tutorial for Raspberry Pi Pico and collected links etc. for MicroPython documentation.

Wednesday
    Rebuilt the circuit again(!)
    Still having problem with small current/voltage when using indirect position of sensor. Group says it should work and we don't need amplifier. A bit lost and don't know what to do.
    Tested several things like increasing voltage and decreasing resistance for IR diode. Increasing resistance for photodiode. 
    More researching. Can't find any IR sensor circuit that doesn't use amplifier.

Thursday
    Tested building an amplifier with uA741. Bad response. Think the current might be to small? Also got very slow and unstable response.

Friday
    Showed the circuit and that the voltage was too small to be recognized by Raspberry Pi. Did the same tests again with a lab partner.
    Finally came to conclusion to add a transimpedance amplifier and got to put another OP amp in the shopping list.

WEEK 38

Monday
  Grand Meeting / Presentation.


Tuesday
  - Working on Arduino code for IR sensor and measurement.
  - Testing oscilloscope in project room :)
  - Want to add an op-amp and potentiometer to the circuit and look up correct resistance for IR-diode in hand.


Wednesday
  - "Research": 
      We probably want a transresistance amplifier circuit since photodiode gives change in current (or actually resistance). Convert to a voltage gain. 
      Standard op amp seems to be LM358.
      Example circuit:
      https://www.ti.com/lit/an/sboa268a/sboa268a.pdf?ts=1695189607426&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F
      How get negative power to op amp? Can we use two of the batteries for that? Probably not.
      Op amp don't function in negative temperatures? Solved by being placed on inside part of door?
      Can we use a UA741 instead and how bias it differently?
      Can we get away without op amp to save power? 

  -  Simulated transresistance amp in PSpice. Compared gain LM358 and µA741.

Fick hjälp från Johan:
TODO:   kolla hur stor strömskillnad från uppmätt graf (använde spännings-tricket)!
        designa komparator krets utifrån detta, hur stor diff i ström räcker? (kan vi skippa förstärkaren)?
        hitta lämplig komponenter komparator: läckström (ca 1 nA okej), RRIO (ca 6V), gain bandwith product GBP ca 0.5 MHz okej).
        bias krets för matning från batteri (endast positiv matning) ca 4V bias punkt

        ev. inte för avancerat filter som inte dämpar signalen för mycket.
