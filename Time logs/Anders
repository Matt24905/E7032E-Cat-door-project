    Solder wires to the catflap with Matilda.
    Kept working with the PCB and kept working on ordering components.
    
  Thursday:
    Added correct footprint and searched for parts.
    Kept working on the PCB and its finish. :)
        
  Friday:
    Worked with Agnes to get a circuit for the IR-sensor.
    Finish the PCB and order components.    

    

WEEK 39:
  Monday:
    Meeting with Jan.

  Tuesday:
    Meeting with the group.
    Worked with Matilda on getting the LEDS to work with button and also manage to control the motor with some buttons.
    
  Wednesday:
    Moral support for Matilda when she fixed the two buttons to work for the LED.
    Tested to assembly the catflap and see if the catflap responded to a tag, but no sucess.
    
  Thursday:
    Nothing.
  Friday:
    Nothing.

  Sunday:
    Found some IC for the PCB and looked more into powermanagement.


WEEK 38:
  Monday:
    Meeting with Jan.

  Tuesday:
    Meeting with the peebs.
    Starting to work with powermanagement of the project.
    Looked in to Raspberry pi pico and RP2040.

  Wednesday:
    Worked with Matilda to control some led's and also measure the voltage of the Motor with a oscilloscope.
    Planned with Matilda and Nabaz on how the buttons are gonna operate on the PCB, what button do what.

  Thursday:
    Tested in practice some circuits for MOSFET application in order to learn and use it in some parts of the project.
