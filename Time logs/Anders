WEEK 37:
  Monday:
    Had a meeting with Jan.

  Tuesday:
    Worked on controlling a DC-motor and be able to drive it in different directions with the help of and H-Bro.
  
  Wednesday:
    Made the H-Bridge better with MOSFET in order to draw more current compare to the BJT (200mA).
  
  Thursday:
    And measure the motor and determine that we are done with that part of the whole project.
    Find a H-brdige IC that are able to handle our motor and be able to controll it with a microcontroller. 
    Manage to get more lab equipment in order to do basic measurements in the project room.
    Helped Nabaz with IR-sensor.
  
  Friday:
    Talked to Joakim to find where our order stuff are.
    Email Jan in order to see where the components are.
    Did more planning for the entire project and see how its going.
    Help with flowchart of what happens when the cat goes in the cat flap.


WEEK 38:
  Monday:
    Meeting with Jan.

  Tuesday:
    Meeting with the peebs.
    Starting to work with powermanagement of the project.
    Looked in to Raspberry pi pico and RP2040.

  Wednesday:
    Worked with Matilda to control some led's and also measure the voltage of the Motor with a oscilloscope.
    Planned with Matilda and Nabaz on how the buttons are gonna operate on the PCB, what button do what.

  Thursday:
    Tested in practice some circuits for MOSFET application in order to learn and use it in some parts of the project.

  Friday:
    Worked with Matilda as we manage to get the raspberry pi pico to work with python code.
    Played around with some LEDs and Button in order to learn and implement them in the project.
    Planned work for next week.
    Helped Matidla fixed powerpoint for next week.
    Did some planning for the future of the project.
