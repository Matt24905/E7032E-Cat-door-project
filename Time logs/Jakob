Week 36:

General research for the RFID antenna, and how it works on a basic level.

Week 37:

Meeting with Johan Borg to discuss RFID antennas in more detail.

Was present as we measured the output of an RFID pet chip tag. 

Did further research on the theoretical aspect of RFID antenna design, focusing on how we can increase the reading range. 

Week 38: 

Started working on an experimental setup mechanism to enable easy testing of the antenna range/angle experiments that will be 3D printed. Did not get as much work done this week as I had hoped.

Week 39: 

Designed, printed and assembled the experimental setup.
