Week 36:

General research for the RFID antenna, and how it works on a basic level.

Week 37:

Meeting with Johan Borg to discuss RFID antennas in more detail.

Was present as we measured the output of an RFID pet chip tag. 

Did further research on the theoretical aspect of RFID antenna design, focusing on how we can increase the reading range. 

Week 38: 

Started working on an experimental setup mechanism to enable easy testing of the antenna range/angle experiments that will be 3D printed. Did not get as much work done this week as I had hoped.

Week 39: 

Designed, printed and assembled the experimental setup.

Week 40: 

Did some more research on how RFID antennas work and started simulating on a new design. 

Week 41: 

Meeting with Johan Borg to discuss the current 

Week 42:

I did not do any work on the project whatsoever this week as i focused on studying for an exam. 

Week 43:

Made major progress on the antenna circuits after simulating and discussing with Johan Borg. At the moment we now have in simulation a fully functional antenna driving circuit, from driving the coils to sending digital signals to the microcontrollers.
I suggested adding a passive notch filter before the comparator to help remove more of the 125kHz carrier wave which worked well. Considering swapping it for an active notch filter with some gain, will experiment more with this later. 
Did some minor testing/coding with the Raspberry Pi Pico to test its signal generating capabilities and found that it was fast enough to generate a 125kHz signal.
