Week 36
Research about the components which is given with the catflap (all except the antenna).
Searched for substitution components that can replace excisting ones. 

Week 37
Built a prototype IR break beam diode circuit with arduino code. When the prototype was up and 
running I started working on the exciting IR diodes that's on the catflap. Researched how they react to
different resistor values and where the optimal voltage supply is to get a decent sensor output.
