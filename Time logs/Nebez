Week 36
Research about the components which is given with the catflap (all except the antenna).
Searched for substitution components that can replace excisting ones. 

Week 37
Built a prototype IR break beam diode circuit with arduino code. When the prototype was up and 
running I started working on the exciting IR diodes that's on the catflap. Researched how they react to
different resistor values and where the optimal voltage supply is to get a decent sensor output.

Week 38
The IR sensors is the one thing that is going to be constantly ON. So I been looking in to different ways 
for the component to draw as little power as possible. The solution might be that the rsp pico will pulse
PWM signals to a MOSFET which will act as an gate to activate the current for the sensor, which means we can control
when and how often the IR sensors will be ON. 
Another problem is the signal when we actually reads something. This needs to be amplified and a comparator might be the answer 
to my prayers.
