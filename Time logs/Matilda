WEEK 37

- Worked on the motor. Implemented an H-bridge circuit and tested the operation of the motor in the cat flap.
  Discovered the needed voltage to keep the performance whilst also being energy efficient by testing different 
  voltages. Made some improvements with different transistors to get enough power for the motor. 
- Chose the IC for the H-bridge so we don't have to make our own. 
- Written a first draft for some of the report for the motor. Still needs to be a bit prettier and I'm also
  adding pictures, but it's a start. 
- Made a presentatiton for the Monday-meeting
- Joined Arvid and Jakob for the measuring of the antenna with a fancy oscilloscope. Learnt a bit about how the
  antenna is working, will be interesting to see what they do with the findings! 
- Had an update-meeting with Jan
- Fixed tools for the project room
- Project manager things (planning, thinking, goals, getting updates from the rest of the group, thinking about 
  deadlines and the coming weeks etc)
- Made a flowchart for the cat flap.
- Not gotten access to the project room :(
