WEEK 47
- Meeting with Anders, project management things, updated GANTT-chart and found discussion points for the 
  group meeting. 
- Tested so I can control the actual catflap from my phone, can control LEDs and the motor. 

WEEK 46
- Created a database from which I can find, add, and delete entries. 
- Played around more with wifi and servers, can control pins from my phone.
- Coding in progress, lots of unefined work that's difficult to write down in bullet points. Working on 
  creating entries in the database when receiving input from the cat flap, as well as figurung out how to 
  structure the code to ensure best practices. 

WEEK 45
- Worked all week, received the raspberry pi tuesday, managed to get wifi up and running

WEEK 44
- Finished the PCB, buttons, LEDs, and motor now works with our code!
- Meeting with Jan
- Meeting with the group
- Attempted signal analysis with the antenna data, not a whole lot of success... 

WEEK 43
- Kept looking into the PCB
- Waiting for the raspberry, kind of stuck doing busy work until it arrives :(

WEEK 42
- Soldered the first draft of the PCB with Anders, solved errors and issues, managed to get most of it working
- Meeting with Jan
- Meeting with the group

WEEK 41
- Made a first draft of a sequence diagram and use case diagram
- Meeting with Jan
- Meeting with the group
- Report

WEEK 40
- Report
- Meeting with Jan
- Meeting with the group
- Smaller tasks (planning, measurements etc.)
- Played around with making an app
- Worked on sending/receiving data from the raspberry & researched how to do it over WiFi
- Examine motor using the power profile kit, understanding the results. 

WEEK 39
- Got buttons and LEDs to work as intended!
- Rewrote motor code for python and the raspberry
- Meeting with Jan
- Meeting with the group
- Started working on database
- Desired functionality for the app 

WEEK 38
- Gotten access to the project room! :)
- Worked on UML diagrams to structure the software part of the design. Completed an activity diagram and a basic 
  class diagram. More will need to be added as the project proceeds, but it should be sufficient for now. 
- Had a meeting with the group to discuss goals for the midterm presentation and other questions/discussions that
  came up over the week. 
- Had a meeting with Jan.

WEEK 37

- Worked on the motor. Implemented an H-bridge circuit and tested the operation of the motor in the cat flap.
  Discovered the needed voltage to keep the performance whilst also being energy efficient by testing different 
  voltages. Made some improvements with different transistors to get enough power for the motor. 
- Chose the IC for the H-bridge so we don't have to make our own. 
- Written a first draft for some of the report for the motor. Still needs to be a bit prettier and I'm also
  adding pictures, but it's a start. 
- Made a presentatiton for the Monday-meeting
- Joined Arvid and Jakob for the measuring of the antenna with a fancy oscilloscope. Learnt a bit about how the
  antenna is working, will be interesting to see what they do with the findings! 
- Had an update-meeting with Jan
- Fixed tools for the project room
- Project manager things (planning, thinking, goals, getting updates from the rest of the group, thinking about 
  deadlines and the coming weeks etc)
- Made a flowchart for the cat flap.
- Not gotten access to the project room :(
